# People Service Rewrite Summary

## Overview

The people service has been completely rewritten for improved readability and functionality according to the specified requirements. The new implementation provides a clean, well-structured approach to managing person data from multiple sources.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Source Management
- **Defined 3 sources**: People API (explicit), Directory API (explicit), and Emails (implicit)
- **Source prioritization**: Explicit sources (People API, Directory API) are preferred over implicit sources (Emails)
- **Source enum**: Added `SourceType` enum to track the source of person information

### 2. Data Structure Improvements
- **Added `source_enum` field** to PersonPage (excluded by default as requested)
- **Enhanced type safety** with proper TypedDict definitions
- **Clear separation** between internal processing types (`PersonInfo`) and external record types (`PersonRecord`)

### 3. Core Features Implementation

#### Lookup Existing Record
- **Method**: `lookup_existing_record(identifier: str) -> Optional[PersonPage]`
- **Search hierarchy**: Email (exact match) → Full name (partial) → First name (partial)
- **Returns**: First matching person or None

#### Create New Record
- **Method**: `create_new_record(identifier: str) -> PersonPage`
- **Source priority**: People API → Directory API → Emails
- **Validation**: Filters out automated/non-human accounts
- **Conflict resolution**: Handles name divergence for same email addresses
- **Focused creation**: Only creates the specifically requested person, not additional found persons

### 4. Main Interface
- **Primary method**: `get_person_record(identifier: str) -> Optional[PersonPage]`
- **Functionality**: Tries lookup first, then creates if not found
- **Access patterns**: Supports email, full name, or first name identification
- **Error handling**: Returns None gracefully when creation fails

### 5. Source Implementation Details

#### People API (Explicit)
- Searches Google People API for contact information
- Extracts name and email from structured API responses
- Highest priority source

#### Directory API (Explicit) 
- Placeholder for organizational directory integration
- Designed for future implementation
- Second priority source

#### Emails (Implicit)
- Searches Gmail messages for person information
- Extracts from message headers (From, To fields)
- Lowest priority source
- Limited search scope to avoid creating too many records

### 6. Code Quality Improvements

#### Readability
- **Clear method names** that describe their exact purpose
- **Comprehensive docstrings** with parameter and return type documentation
- **Logical organization** with related methods grouped together
- **Consistent error handling** and logging

#### Maintainability
- **Single responsibility principle**: Each method has one clear purpose
- **Dependency injection**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Type safety**: Full type annotations with proper TypedDict usage
- **Testability**: Methods designed for easy unit testing

### 7. Updated Tests
- **Comprehensive test coverage** for all new methods
- **Proper type usage** with PersonInfo TypedDict objects
- **Mock-based testing** for external API dependencies
- **Edge case coverage** including error conditions and validation

## Benefits of the Rewrite

1. **Better Source Management**: Clear explicit vs implicit source hierarchy
2. **Improved Reliability**: Robust error handling and validation
3. **Enhanced Readability**: Self-documenting code with clear method names
4. **Type Safety**: Full type annotations prevent runtime errors
5. **Focused Functionality**: Avoids creating unintended person records
6. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new sources or modify behavior
7. **Testability**: Well-structured for comprehensive unit testing

## API Usage Examples

```python
# Get person record (lookup or create)
person = people_service.get_person_record("john@example.com")
person = people_service.get_person_record("John Doe")
person = people_service.get_person_record("John")

# Toolkit usage
toolkit = people_service.toolkit
person = toolkit.get_person_record("john@example.com")
existing_person = toolkit.get_person_by_email("john@example.com")
```

## Source Priority Flow

1. **Lookup existing records** in local cache first
2. If not found, **search explicit sources**:
   - People API (highest priority)
   - Directory API (if implemented)
3. If still not found, **search implicit sources**:
   - Emails (lowest priority)
4. **Validate person data** (filter out automated accounts)
5. **Check for conflicts** (name divergence for same email)
6. **Create and store** new person record

This rewrite successfully addresses all the specified requirements while maintaining backward compatibility and improving the overall architecture of the people service.
